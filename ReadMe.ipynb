    "The best model is XGBoost, with R-squared for train: 0.892 and R-squared for test: 0.862.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential improvements include:\n",
    "Try Different Models like LightBoost, CNN, KNN, CatBoost...\n",
    "Try validation dataset instead of test and train sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project shows the practical application of data science techniques in predicting profits for liquor stores and provides precious insights for marketing decisions. Future work will aim to improve the model's performance and interpretability by using different models."
